# RegistrySample

Example application using the new `Registry` module in Elixir 1.4

See this [blog post](https://medium.com/@adammokan/registry-in-elixir-1-4-0-d6750fb5aeb#.7cnipan20) for more context.

## The Basics

### Clone the Repo

`git clone git@github.com:amokan/registry_sample.git`

### Run the sample in IEX

```
cd registry_sample
iex -S mix
```

### Scenario

From the [blog post](https://medium.com/@adammokan/registry-in-elixir-1-4-0-d6750fb5aeb#.7cnipan20):

_Imagine we have a scenario where we are selling widgets to customers. Our boss wants us to build a realtime UI that shows every account that has placed an order in the current day along with some basic info about each account. If an account doesnâ€™t place another order within 24 hours, it should fall off the UI_

### RegistrySample.AccountDynamicSupervisor

The `RegistrySample.AccountDynamicSupervisor` is a `:one_for_one` dynamic supervisor that gives us a few helpful functions for creating new `RegistrySample.Account` processes and indicating which processes are already running.

Let's create an account process for `account_id` # 2 and `account_id` # 10.
```
iex> RegistrySample.AccountDynamicSupervisor.find_or_create_process(2)
{:ok, 2}

iex> RegistrySample.AccountDynamicSupervisor.find_or_create_process(10)
{:ok, 2}

iex> RegistrySample.AccountDynamicSupervisor.get_all_account_widgets_ordered
[%{account_id: 2, widgets_sold: 1}, %{account_id: 10, widgets_sold: 1}]
```

Now we can say that `account_id` # 10 ordered another widget, by just passing the `account_id`

```
iex> RegistrySample.Account.order_widget(10)
:ok

iex> RegistrySample.AccountDynamicSupervisor.get_all_account_widgets_ordered
[%{account_id: 2, widgets_sold: 1}, %{account_id: 10, widgets_sold: 2}]
```
